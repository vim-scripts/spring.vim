The spring.vim is a color sheme file (only for GVIM), which make the VIM bright with colors. It just like the flowers are in blossom in Spring. Additionally, it is said that there is a kind of light green color (RGB code: #cce8cf) which can avoid the eyestrain, at least make your eyes more comfortable. So the spring.vim was born.
